# 42 - LIBFT PROJECT

### Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn't have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to check which functions are allowed!

### Technical Considerations
* It is forbidden to declare global variables
* If you need sub-functions to write a complex function, you should define these sub-functions as static to avoid publishing them with your library
* Every .c file must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror
* You must use the command ar to create your library, using the command libtool is forbidden
